## 0:00 – 0:15 Problem and Context

Recording tips
- Wait ~1–2 seconds after the mic beep so recognition starts cleanly.
- Speak short commands clearly; pause briefly for page transitions.
- If AI rate limits, retry after ~1 minute (fallback model may trigger).
- Ensure browser mic and location permissions are allowed; on mobile enable “Precise Location.”
